CS6852 Assignment 4: Inference using OWL

Folder contents:
CS22M086_Family_Ontology.ttl - updated owl file from assignment 3. Format is turtle.
element, matter and universe xml files from assignment 2
CS22M086_Assignment_4.ipynb - python code to infer data into ontology from xml files


Executing the file:
Open the CS22M086_Assignment_4.ipynb file in jupyter file
Make sure you open the file from the folder containing the .xml files
After Execution CS22M086_Infered_Triples.txt file is created it containes the triples added to the ontology.

To check the consistency, open the CS22M086_Infered.ttl (after running the python code so that all triples are added to ontology) in protege
Start the reasoner (Reasoner - Start Reasoner)


On doing the above steps, we can see that the final ontology is coherent and consistent.
